1.  Capomulin had by far the best response regarding tumor volume, number of metastatic sites and survival rate over the course of the study.

2.  In regard to tumor response to treatment, Ketapril's average tumor volume over time and tumor percent change was higher than the placebo group suggesting that this drug may induce tumor growth.

3.  Infubinol showed significant reduction in preventing metastatic spread, but had similar results to the placebo and Ketapril in tumor growth and survival rates.
